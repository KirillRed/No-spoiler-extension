# Anti-spoiler
## Introduction
---
This extension is made to protect you from spoilers.

You can set forbidden keywords and if we find any of these keywords in the title of the video, it will be hidden. You will be able to know keyword(s) that are in this video. Of course, you can restore it if you want.

You can also set exceptions. Exceptions are videos that you don't want to hide.

I hope you enjoy this extension! If not, please let me know what is wrong.
